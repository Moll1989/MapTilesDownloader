## So what does it do?

This tiny python based script allows you to download map tiles from Google, Bing, Open Street Maps, ESRI, NASA, and other providers. This script comes with an easy to use web based map UI for selecting the area and previewing tiles.

**Installation on Raspberry Pi for use with chasemapper**
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip libopenjp2-7-dev
pip3 install pillow
git clone https://github.com/Moll1989/MapTilesDownloader
cd MapTilesDownloader/src
python3 server.py
```

Then open up the device you use for viewing chasemapper and navigate to port 5002 instead of 5001. The output map tiles will be in the `~/Maps/` directory by default.

## Requirements

Needs **Python 3.0+**, [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) library, libopenjp2-7-dev and a modern web browser. 

## Purpose

This fork has been customised to be suitable for running alongside chasemapper on a Raspberry Pi.  This makes it really easy to jump on and download maps before going on a balloon chase.

## Important Disclaimer

Downloading map tiles is subject to the terms and conditions of the tile provider. Some providers such as Google Maps have restrictions in place to avoid abuse, therefore before downloading any tiles make sure you understand their TOCs. I recommend not using Google, Bing, and ESRI tiles in any commercial application without their consent.
